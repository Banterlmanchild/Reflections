Git commands:
git status; see all the files that have changed since the last commit
git init; initialise a git repository
git add; add specified files to a git staging area before committing
git commit; commit all changes in the staging area, you have to use it with
	the -m option to add a message in quotation marks
git diff --staged; see the differences between the staging area and the last
	commit
git branch; no arguments shows all the branches, if you add an argument after
	then it will create a branch with that argument as the branch name
git checkout -b new_branch_name; creates a new branch called new_branch_name
	and then runs git checkout to that new branch
git merge main_branch updated_branch; merge the 2 branches together, where you
	update the main_branch with changes from the updated_branch
git show; you add the git ID as an argument and this shows the difference
	between this commit and the parent
git branch -d branch_name; delete the branch label branch_name
When you initialise a repository then git creates a hidden directory with the
history of all the files in it

A staging area is an intermedite between the working directory (local) and
the commit (git) and it bundles files together to commit them in one thing as
opposed to committing every individual fiel from the working directory

If something is in the staging area it will come under "changes to be
committed" when running git status

For branches an asterix shows the branch that is currently checked out

You can change which branch you're editting on by using git checkout

Then when you change something in the file and commit it, it will commit on
that branch only

Branches are useful if you have a version of something that you want to add
an experimental feature to, something that might not work, so you do all the
edits on that branch and commit it to that branch. This keeps the experimental
and risky changes off the master branch so you always have a working version

Be careful about committing changes on a detatched HEAD state as these won't be
updated on any branch and you can't get those commits back

If you're going to merge 2 branches together, decided which one wants to be
added to the other, and make sure you're on the branch that you want to
"update" with changes. For example it might be a feature you want to add to
the main project, then be on master branch and use "git merge master update"
Where the update is the branch with features you want to add
