Git commands:
git status; see all the files that have changed since the last commit
git init; initialise a git repository
git add; add specified files to a git staging area before committing

When you initialise a repository then git creates a hidden directory with the
history of all the files in it

A staging area is an intermedite between the working directory (local) and
the commit (git) and it bundles files together to commit them in one thing as
opposed to committing every individual fiel from the working directory

If something is in the staging area it will come under "changes to be
committed" when running git status
