We can use diif -u to output in uniform diff format.
Anything with a - is the old doc and a + in the new doc
Lines without a + or - are in both code

Different software use version control, in google docs and dropbox for example
This makes you more efficient because you can undo edits that don't work

Git commands:
git diff; this is git's version of the diff command
git log; you can see all the commits to that project
git log --stat; see what files were affected in the commit and more info

Pros and cons of manual commit choosing:
Pro, logical changes are committed and code still understandable
Con, forget to commit and you loose your work

Multiple file tracking is useful because if your code spans more than one file
they all get updated together, even if they weren't all changed

With git diff you have to count all of the changes, there's not a summary

You will be more confident because you can identify where bugs were introduced
and easily revert those changes if needed
